Notes:
------
I have chosen this framework as it is able to handle and solve most of the tasks as it allows us to add dynamic behaviour to the webpage.

Improvements -- We can remove the unused JavaScript and avoid using too much memory.

Differently do --- I can create auto playing videos,or ome interactive images.

About Challenge -- It was a brainstorming task,enjoyed this personally. Took a bit long time for me to setup as my personal Laptop,
(very old) was not too compatible and not friendly.
